Theme Name: Cormorant
Theme URI: https://cormorant.kunokoji.com
description: This theme is Block Theme supporting Full Site Editing. Gifu City in Gifu Prefecture, Japan is famous for a traditional fishing method called Ukai (cormorant fishing). That's how I came up with the name. Simple design, universal designed fonts available, many block patterns and styles. You can use for blog, single page for business, self portfolio, and more. This theme will be tested trying for new featured WordPress. So occasional disruptive changes may be made.
