This theme is designed as a block theme to support WordPress full site editing.

Gifu City in Gifu Prefecture, Japan is famous for a traditional event called Ukai (cormorant fishing). That's how I came up with the name.

You must have the Gutenberg Plugin Activate to use this theme before ready for full site editing on released WordPress.
